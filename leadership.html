            <h1>Leadership</h1>
            
            <p>We believe that the offices sanctioned by the New Testament are
            elders and deacons.</p>
            
            <p>The function of the <dfn>elders</dfn> is to exercise
            shepherd-like oversight of the church. They have responsibility for
            the pastoral care, leadership and teaching of the members of the
            congregation. We are committed to a shared ministry of leadership
            where all elders are subject to one another.</p>
            
            <p>The task of the <dfn>deacons</dfn> is to relieve the elders of
            the burden of responsibility for the material affairs of the church
            and to support them in every way possible.</p>

              <p>After serving a Mechanical Engineering Apprenticeship he went on to study Mechanical Engineering at Bradford University and although having been brought up in a Christian home, itwas whilst at Bradford that he realised the truth of the gospel and the hopelessness of a life without God.

            <h2>Colin Dyke</h2>
            <p class="subheading">Deacon - Church secretary</p>
            
            <div class="profile">
              <img src="images/profiles/colin-dyke.jpg" alt="">
              
              <p>Colin is our Church Secretary. He became a Christian through the witness of two Christian friends. He could see that there was something different in the lives of these friends that gave them a peace that he knew nothing about.
              
              <p>On Good Friday 1975 Colin picked up a copy of a Christian newspaper in the digs where he was living. One article that Colin turned to again and again was one that explained that Jesus had died on the cross for sinful people and that we all needed to confess our sin before God.
              
              <p>Colin says: "After thinking these things over for a while I went to my room and prayed, asking God to forgive my sins and come into my life as Lord and Saviour."</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>John Hocking</h2>
            <p class="subheading">Deacon - Church treasurer</p>
            
            <div class="profile">
              <img src="images/profiles/john-hocking.jpg" alt="">
              
              <p>John’s role in the church is Treasurer and as such, he is responsible for overall management of the church finances, including budgeting and making payments to the various missionaries and organisations we support, as well as dealing with day to day expenses.
              
              <p>John was brought up as a Roman Catholic and attended church regularly, until his teenage years, when he became indifferent to organised religion.  One evening, whilst out in Chester city centre, John was invited to a coffee bar where he met people who attended church, not out of duty, but because they had a living and vibrant relationship with God. John was challenged by this and realising the importance of a personal living relationship with God through the Lord Jesus Christ, made a commitment himself at the age of 20 and has never regretted following Christ ever since.
              
              <p>As a husband, father and Christian businessman, John is able to testify of God’s involvement in his life on a daily basis, adding a whole new purpose and meaning to life on earth which was never there previously and a promise and assurance of eternal life with God in heaven when he dies. </p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Peter Siddorn</h2>
            <p class="subheading">Deacon</p>
            
            <div class="profile">
              <img src="images/profiles/peter-siddorn.jpg" alt="">
              
              <p>Peter's role as a deacon in the church is to take primary responsibility for the church site and building. He and his wife met while they were studying veterinary science at Liverpool University. They now run a farm on the outskirts of Chester. It was in 1975, during his studies at Liverpool, that Peter became a Christian.
              
              <p>Having been brought up to attend the local anglican church Peter was challenged by the Christians he met at uni. It was obvious that they had more than a head knowledge of the Bible. They claimed to know Jesus Christ personally.
              
              <p>Over several months of attending the university Christian Union, Peter realised that he needed to ask God to forgive the sins of his past, and ask the Lord Jesus Christ to come into his life as both Saviour and Lord.
              
              <p>Peter has never regretted making that step of faith and today is still seeking to know God better and discover new lessons to be learnt and applied from His Word, the Bible.

            <h2>Gavin Weir</h2>
            <p class="subheading">Deacon</p>
            
            <div class="profile">
              <img src="images/profiles/gavin-weir.jpg" alt="">
              
              <p>Gavin has been part of Upton Baptist Church from its
              establishment.</p>
              
              <p>In his early teenage years, he came into a personal
              relationship with God through Jesus Christ. His family were
              involved with a local church, but he realised that he needed to
              make a personal response to the love of God and to receive
              forgiveness from Him. He realised that God had done everything
              through Jesus Christ and that he could do nothing himself to earn
              forgiveness.</p>
              
              <p>He says: "I'm grateful to God for my marriage to Ruth and for
              our daughter and son [now grown up]. I've been active in the work
              of the Church over the years, particularly with outreach, and I
              was made a deacon in the 1970s. My retirement from full time work
              a few years ago has given opportunity to extend my involvement.</p>
              
              <p>"Throughout my life and activity I've been conscious of God
              leading me, and working things out for me."</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Ian Thompson</h2>
            <p class="subheading">Deacon</p>
            
            <div class="profile">
              <img src="images/profiles/ian-thompson.jpg" alt="">
              
              <p>Ian came to the church in 2003, and continues to enjoy the
              teaching, fellowship, and support that characterises Upton
              Baptist. He became a Christian in his early teens after hearing
              the gospel several thousand times since his earliest years, but it
              was only at that point that the Lord showed him he needed to
              personally turn to Him for forgiveness.</p>
              
              <p>He is married to Liz (a paediatric consultant) and they have
              two bright and cheery daughters, Rachel and Emily. His
              professional background is IT/management, but he is currently
              splitting his time between minding Rachel and Emily, a part-time
              BA theology course from WEST, and potentially other part time
              employment.</p>
              
              <p>Within the church Ian serves as a deacon focusing on the
              communication and IT equipment, helping with Friday Club, and
              various other activities.</p>
              
              <p>Any spare time is taken up with walking their two Labradors,
              photography, hill walking, mountain biking and off-road
              running.</p>
