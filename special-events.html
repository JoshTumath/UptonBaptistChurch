            <h1>Special events</h1>
            <p>We believe that the Bible is the Word of God and that God brings
            people to salvation through it. Many of the activities we involve
            ourselves in are directed towards making the gospel of the Lord
            Jesus Christ more widely known. As our mission policy states, we are
            committed to preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ to people
            from all nations; this obviously includes those from our own
            district and city. Some of these activities are listed below.</p>
            
            <h2>Holiday Bible Club 2013</h2>
            <p>This is held for 5-11 year olds over a week in August. Dates for
            2013 are: Tuesday 27 August until Friday 30 August.</p>
            
            <p>As well as having great fun, the children learn about the Bible
            through stories, songs and discussion. Activities include:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>team games</li>
              <li>Bible stories and songs based on a theme for the week.</li>
              <li>craft activities</li>
              <li>indoor games</li>
              <li>field games to suit boys and girls</li>
              <li>refreshments to keep the energy levels up in a busy 3
              hours!</li>
              <li>Bible lesson time when children are taught in their own age
              group</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>In their teaching groups they learn in more detail about the
            story for the day and are encouraged to talk about it.</p>
            
            <p>At the end of the week, the children's parents are invited in to
            see the craft items made, join in with the songs learnt during the
            week and hear a summary of the Bible stories.</p>
            
            <h2>Open air services</h2>
            <p>For one Sunday afternoon in each of the summer months we gathered
            at in the Chester city centre to hold open-air evangelistic
            services. The afternoon slot has proved to be better than our usual
            evening time - there were more strollers happy to stop and listen.
            We were encouraged by the level of interest and plan to continue
            this work.</p>
            
            <h2>Gideons International</h2>
            <p>A number of our members are actively involved with the local
            branch of <a href="//www.gideons.org.uk/">Gideons
            International</a>. The local branch makes the Scriptures available
            to residents of nursing homes, to hotel and B&amp;B guests, to
            nurses, to business people and to school children as they enter
            secondary school.</p>
            
            <h2>Bible Study Fellowship</h2>
            <p><a href="//www.bsfinternational.org/">BSF International</a> is an
            interdenominational, not-for-profit, lay organisation which aims to
            establish people in a knowledge and understanding of the truth of
            the Bible. This is achieved using questions for personal study,
            participation in discussion groups, lectures and printed notes.</p>
            
            <h2>Chester Schools Christian Work</h2>
            <p>Chester is privledged in that our senior schools have a Christian
            witness through the Schools Worker project, an initiative which is
            part of Scripture Union. For more details see
            <a href="//sites.google.com/site/chesterschoolschristianwork/">Chester
            Christian Schools Work</a>.</p>
            
            <h2>Go Teach Publications</h2>
            Our Sunday School teaching material has to reflect our biblical
            stance and we regularly use material produced by
            <a href="//www.goteach.org.uk/">Go Teach</a>.
